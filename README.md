# Weather_Dashboard
This application was designed with the idea of a weather dashboard that could display single and five day forecasts with uv rating for multiple cities in the United States and some other countries using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api). Unfortunately it is incomplete and being updated.
